## Versioning

Realm Flutter and Dart SDK packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
During the initial development the packages will be versioned according the scheme `0.major.minor+release stage` until the first stable version is reached then packages will be versioned with `major.minor.patch` scheme.

The first versions will follow `0.1.0+preview`, `0.1.1+preview` etc.
Then next release stages will pick up the next minor version `0.1.2+beta`, `0.1.3+beta`. This will ensure dependencies are updated on `dart pub get` with the new `alpha`, `beta` versions.
If an `alpha` version is released before `beta` and it needs to not be considered for `pub get` then it should be marked as `prerelease` with `-alpha` so  `0.1.2-alpha` etc.
Updating the major version with every release stage is also possible - `0.2.0+alpha`, `0.3.0+beta`, `0.3.1+beta`.
