Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the Realm SDK for Flutter™ and Dart™.

**This project is in the Beta stage. The API should be quite stable, but occasional breaking changes may be made.**

## Getting Started

* Import Realm in a dart file `app.dart`

    ```dart
    import 'package:realm/realm.dart';  // import realm package

    part 'app.g.dart'; // declare a part file.

    @RealmModel() // define a data model class named `_Car`.
    class _Car {
      late String make;

      late String model;

      int? kilometers = 500;
    }
    ```

* Generate RealmObject class `Car` from data model class `_Car`.

    ```
    flutter pub run realm generate
    ```

* Open a Realm and add some objects.

    ```dart
    var config = Configuration([Car.schema]);
    var realm = Realm(config);

    var car = Car("Tesla", "Model Y", kilometers: 5);
    realm.write(() {
      realm.add(car);
    });
    ```

* Query objects in Realm.

    ```dart
    var cars = realm.all<Car>();
    Car myCar = cars[0];
    print("My car is ${myCar.make} model ${myCar.model}");

    cars = realm.all<Car>().query("make == 'Tesla'");
    ```

* Get stream of result changes for a query.

    ```dart
    final cars = realm.all<Car>().query(r'make == $0', ['Tesla']);
    cars.changes.listen((changes) {
      print('Inserted indexes: ${changes.inserted}');
      print('Deleted indexes: ${changes.deleted}');
      print('Modified indexes: ${changes.modified}');
    });
    realm.write(() => realm.add(Car('VW', 'Polo', kilometers: 22000)));
    ```

## Limitations

* It provides the functionality for creating, retrieving, querying, sorting, filtering, updating Realm objects.

* Migrations are not supported yet.

    If you change your data models often and receive a migration exception be sure to delete the old `default.realm` file in your application directory. It will get recreated with the new schema the next time the Realm is opened.

# Realm Flutter SDK

The Realm Flutter package name is `realm`

## Environment setup for Realm Flutter

* Supported platforms are Flutter (iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS) and Dart standalone (Windows, MacOS and Linux)

* Flutter ^3.0
* For Flutter Desktop environment setup check the guide [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/desktop)
* Cocoapods v1.11 or newer
* CMake 3.21 or newer

## Usage

**The full contents of `catalog.dart` is listed [after the usage](https://github.com/realm/realm-dart#full-contents-of-catalogdart)**

* Add `realm` package to a Flutter application.

    ```
    flutter pub add realm
    ```

* Import Realm in a dart file (ex. `catalog.dart`).

    ```dart
    import 'package:realm/realm.dart';
    ```

* Declare a part file `catalog.g.dart` in the begining of the `catalog.dart` dart file after all imports.

    ```dart
    import 'dart:io';

    part 'catalog.g.dart';
    ```

* Create a data model class.

    It should start with an underscore `_Item` and be annotated with `@RealmModel()`

    ```dart
    @RealmModel()
    class _Item {
        @PrimaryKey()
        late int id;

        late String name;

        int price = 42;
    }
    ```

* Generate RealmObject class `Item` from data model class `_Item`.

    _*On Flutter use `flutter pub run realm` to run `realm` package commands*_

    ```
    flutter pub run realm generate
    ```
    A new file `catalog.g.dart` will be created next to the `catalog.dart`.

    _*This file should be committed to source control_

* Use the RealmObject class `Item` with Realm.

    ```dart
    // Create a Configuration object
    var config = Configuration([Item.schema]);

    // Opean a Realm
    var realm = Realm(config);

    var myItem = Item(0, 'Pen', price: 4);

    // Open a write transaction
    realm.write(() {
        realm.add(myItem);
        var item = realm.add(Item(1, 'Pencil')..price = 20);
    });

    // Objects `myItem` and `item` are now managed and persisted in the realm

    // Read object properties from realm
    print(myItem.name);
    print(myItem.price);

    // Update object properties
    realm.write(() {
        myItem.price = 20;
        myItem.name = "Special Pencil";
    });

    // Get objects from the realm

    // Get all objects of type
    var items = realm.all<Item>();

    // Get object by index
    var item = items[1];

    // Get object by primary key
    var itemByKey = realm.find<Item>(0);

    // Filter and sort object
    var objects = realm.query<Item>("name == 'Special Pencil'");
    var name = 'Pen';
    objects = realm.query<Item>(r'name == $0', [name]]);

    // Close the realm
    realm.close();
    ```

## Full contents of `catalog.dart`

```dart
import 'package:realm/realm.dart';

part 'catalog.g.dart';

@RealmModel()
class _Item {
    @PrimaryKey()
    late int id;

    late String name;

    int price = 42;
}

// Create a Configuration object
var config = Configuration([Item.schema]);

// Opean a Realm
var realm = Realm(config);

var myItem = Item(0, 'Pen', price: 4);

// Open a write transaction
realm.write(() {
    realm.add(myItem);
    var item = realm.add(Item(1, 'Pencil')..price = 20);
});

// Objects `myItem` and `item` are now managed and persisted in the realm

// Read object properties from realm
print(myItem.name);
print(myItem.price);

// Update object properties
realm.write(() {
    myItem.price = 20;
    myItem.name = "Special Pencil";
});

// Get objects from the realm

// Get all objects of type
var items = realm.all<Item>();

// Get object by index
var item = items[1];

// Get object by primary key
var itemByKey = realm.find<Item>(0);

// Filter and sort object
var objects = realm.query<Item>("name == 'Special Pencil'");
var name = 'Pen';
objects = realm.query<Item>(r'name == $0', [name]]);

// Close the realm
realm.close();
```

# Realm Dart SDK

The Realm Dart package is `realm_dart`

## Environment setup for Realm Dart

* Supported platforms are Windows, Mac and Linux.

* Dart SDK ^2.17

## Usage

* Add `realm_dart` package to a Dart application.

    ```
    dart pub add realm_dart
    ```

* Install the `realm_dart` package into the application. This downloads and copies the required native binaries to the app directory.

    ```
    dart run realm_dart install
    ```

* Import realm_dart in a dart file (ex. `catalog.dart`).

    ```dart
    import 'package:realm_dart/realm.dart';
    ```

* To generate RealmObject classes with realm_dart use this command.

    _*On Dart use `dart run realm_dart` to run `realm_dart` package commands*_

    ```
    dart run realm_dart generate
    ```
    A new file `catalog.g.dart` will be created next to the `catalog.dart`.

    _*This file should be committed to source control_

* For more usage of Realm Dart see the Realm Flutter usage above.

## Running tests

See [test/README.md](https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/master/test/README.md) for instructions on running tests.

## Versioning

Realm Flutter and Dart SDK packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
During the initial development the packages will be versioned according the scheme `0.major.minor+release stage` until the first stable version is reached then packages will be versioned with `major.minor.patch` scheme.

The first versions will follow `0.1.0+preview`, `0.1.1+preview` etc.
Then next release stages will pick up the next minor version `0.1.2+beta`, `0.1.3+beta`. This will ensure dependencies are updated on `dart pub get` with the new `alpha`, `beta` versions.
If an `alpha` version is released before `beta` and it needs to not be considered for `pub get` then it should be marked as `prerelease` with `-alpha` so  `0.1.2-alpha` etc.
Updating the major version with every release stage is also possible - `0.2.0+alpha`, `0.3.0+beta`, `0.3.1+beta`.
