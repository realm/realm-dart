Custom JWT Authentication

The keys in this folder "test/data/jwt_keys" are used only for the purpose of the automatic tests.
They are not needed in production.
The tests that requires these files are related to testing login user to Atlas App using JWT token issued by a custom token provider. For more information read [Custom JWT Authentication](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/custom-jwt/).

The custom tokens are using RSA algorithm and key pair of private (private_key.pem) and public (public_key.pem) keys.
For the purpose of the tests the token could be generated by the following procedure:

1. Generate private_key.pem and public_key.pem files:

    Both files (private_key.pem and public public_key.pem) are generated with `openssl` command https://www.openssl.org/

    * Download `openssl.exe`

    * Generate private key for singing tokens with command: `openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048`

    * Generate publik key for validating tokens with command: `openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem`

    * The tests supports two Verification Methods:
        [Manually Specify Signing Keys](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/custom-jwt/#manually-specify-signing-keys) and [Use a JWK URI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/custom-jwt/#use-a-jwk-uri)

        For testing verification method "Manually Specify Signing Keys" public and private keys are enough. Public key has to be configured into Custom Authentication provider in the clout app. It is done automatically by baas_client.dart where the value of the public key is taken from constant with `publicRSAKeyForJWTValidation` in `test\test.dart`. Be sure to update this value and to delete the old cloud apps if you are generating tokens with newly created key pair.

        For testing verification method "Use a JWK URI" you need to generate jwks.json as follow:

    * Generate jwks.json using some generator. For example: https://russelldavies.github.io/jwk-creator/. Only public key should be included in jwk. Required Key ID (kid) is "1".

2. Generate tokens with dart code using the private key:
    * Create a new dart app.
    * Use [dart_jsonwebtoken](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_jsonwebtoken) package.
    * Run `dart pub add dart_jsonwebtoken`
    * Code sample:
        ```dart
        String username = "username@realm.io";
        String userId = ObjectId().toString();

        final jwt = JWT(
        {
            "sub": userId,
            "name": {"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"},
            "email": username,
            "gender": "male",
            "birthDay": "1999-10-11",
            "minAge": "10",
            "maxAge": "90",
            "company": "Realm",
        },
        issuer: 'https://realm.io',
        audience: Audience(["mongodb.com"]),
        )..header = <String, dynamic>{"kid": "1"};

        // Paste here private key string from private_key.pem file
        String privateKey = '''-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIEowIBAAKCAQEAvNHHs8T0AHD7SJ+CKvVRleeJa4wqYTnaVYV+5bX9FmFXVoN+
        ........
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----''';
        var token = jwt.sign(RSAPrivateKey(privateKey), algorithm: JWTAlgorithm.RS256, expiresIn: Duration(minutes: 3));
        print('Signed token: $token\n');
        ```
    * Once you have the token you can use it to login in the tests with `app.login(Credentials.jwt(token))`. Be sure that the public key configured in the cloud apps is from the correct key pair and corresponds to the private key used for generating this token.
