/// This class represents a user in a MongoDB Realm app.
/// A user can log in to the server and, if access is granted, it is possible to synchronize the local and the remote Realm.
/// Moreover, synchronization is halted when the user is logged out. It is possible to persist a user. By retrieving a user, there is no need to log in again.
/// Persisting a user between sessions, the user's credentials are stored
/// locally on the device, and should be treated as sensitive data.

  final UserHandle _handle;

  User._(this._handle);

/// @nodoc
extension UserInternal on User {
  static User create(UserHandle handle) => User._(handle);
