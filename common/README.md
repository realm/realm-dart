Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the Realm SDK for Flutter™ and Dart™.

**This project is in the Alpha stage. All API's might change without warning and no guarantees are given about stability. Do not use it in production.**

## Getting Started

To use the Realm SDK for Flutter add the [realm](https://pub.dev/packages/realm) package to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies.

To use the Realm SDK for Dart add the [realm_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/realm_dart) package to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies.


* Import Realm.
    ```dart
    import 'package:realm/realm.dart';
    ```

* Define a data model class `_Car`.
    ```dart
    @RealmModel()
    class _Car {
      late String make;

      late String model;
    
      int? kilometers = 500;
    }
    ```

* Generate RealmObject class `Car` from data model class `_Car`.

    ```
    dart run realm generate
    ```

* Open a Realm and add some objects.

    ```dart
    var config = Configuration([Car.schema]);
    var realm = Realm(config);

    var car = Car("Telsa", "Model Y", kilometers: 5);
    realm.write(() {
      realm.add(car);
    }
    ```

* Query objects in Realm.

    ```dart
    var cars = realm.all<Car>();
    Car myCar = cars[0];
    print("My car is ${myCar.make} model ${myCar.model}");

    cars = realm.all<Car>().query("make == 'Tesla'");
    ```
