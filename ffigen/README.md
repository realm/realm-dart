This package configures the ffigen to generate bindings to realm-core library.
The is executed manually as needed and this package is never published.

Usage:

dart run ffigen --config config.yaml

On linux you may need to install clang 11 dev tools. If you are using apt-get you can do:
```
sudo apt-get install libclang-11-dev
```

Note: Dart ffigen tool generated platform dependent bindings which are tailored for the host platform the ffigen is executed. Currently all of platforms generate identical output with the configuration workaround here: https://github.com/dart-lang/ffigen/pull/119.

Dart has an issues to generate platform independent bindings here:
