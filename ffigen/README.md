This package configures the ffigen to generate bindings to realm-core library.
The is executed manually as needed and this package is never published.

Usage: 

On Windows: dart run ffigen --config windows.yaml
On MacOS: dart run ffigen --config macos.yaml
On Linux: dart run ffigen --config linux.yaml

Note: Dart ffigen tool generated platform dependent bindings which are tailored for the host platform the ffigen is executed. Currently all of platforms generate similar output with the configuration workaround here: https://github.com/dart-lang/ffigen/pull/119. 

Dart has an issues to generate platform independent bindings here:
